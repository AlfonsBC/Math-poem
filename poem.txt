Primes and the numbers

The primes,
through times,

mystified
those who pried.

One fact answers why
they are simple yet sly:

Layers of abstraction yield
complex forms when pierced and peeled.

Addition lies under multiplication,
defining him as repeated summation.

Then he defines primes as the atoms of integers,
for when multiplied, they give numbers their signatures.

Is any number that we count banal,
and lacking in a feature one miught note?

And the numbers combined wiht operations
give birth as a delight 

See what the universe of infinity is telling you!!
