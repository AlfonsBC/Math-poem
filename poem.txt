Primes

The primes,
through times,

mystified
those who pried.

One fact answers why
they are simple yet sly:

Layers of abstraction yield
complex forms when pierced and peeled.

Addition lies under multiplication,
defining him as repeated summation.

Then he defines primes as the atoms of integers,
for when multiplied, they give numbers their signatures.
